# Cloud Computing Final Peoject
## Introduction
This is a project for our cloud computing class in NCTU 2015. We make a navigator APP on Android phone that can navigate visitors to their destinations. The UI is clear and clean, the users just need to follow the direction that the arrow in the creen is pointing, and they can easily get to the destination. Of course, be aware where are you walking into during the navigation.  
## Usage
The usage is very simple, the user can chose a destination on the top of the APP by scrolling down the listview, and then press the start buttom in the center. The screen will turn into green when the APP reveives the response from the server, and the navigation shall start.  
In the navigation mode, a big arrow in the center will spin into the direction that your destination is. The direction is estimated by calculating the destination's latitude & lontitude and the GPS of the phone. Sometimes, the direction might be lost, just sipin your phone to initiate the GPS signal to fix the problem.  
## Conclusion
In general speaking, this is a simple but fun program. The most difficult work in this project is the rotaion control when navigating.
